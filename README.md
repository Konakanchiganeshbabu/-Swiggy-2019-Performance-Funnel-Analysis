Project Description:- This project analyzes Swiggy's performance in 2019 by examining order fluctuations, traffic changes, and conversion rates using session data. The goal is to identify key trends in user behavior, assess order highs and lows, and understand the drivers behind any shifts in traffic and conversion metrics.
• Identified significant order fluctuations, focusing on highs and lows in orders compared to the same day the previous week.
• Assessed traffic changes and identified channel-wise sources of traffic fluctuations.
• Broke down overall conversion rates into detailed metrics like L2M (Listing to Menu), M2C (Menu to Cart), C2P (Cart to Payment), and P2O (Payment to Order).
• Generated insights on fluctuating conversion rates and validated hypotheses using supporting data such as average discount, packaging charges, and out-of-stock items.
• Delivered strategic insights to improve user conversion, traffic retention, and overall performance.
